# NewSwindon Project Rules for AI

You are an expert full-stack developer working on the NewSwindon Language Institute platform. Follow these rules to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn/UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, tRPC (v11).
- **Database:** Drizzle ORM with MySQL/TiDB.
- **Validation:** Zod.

## Coding Standards
- **TypeScript:** Use strict typing. Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **Components:** Use functional components with hooks. Prefer modularity.
- **API:** All client-server communication MUST use tRPC. Definitions are in `server/routers.ts`.
- **Database:** Use the Repository Pattern in `server/db.ts`. Do not call Drizzle directly from routers.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Follow the existing design system.
- **Documentation:** Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and complex logic.

## Project Structure
- `client/src/components/`: UI components.
- `client/src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
- `server/_core/`: Core services (auth, email, env).
- `shared/`: Shared types and constants.

## AI Interaction
- When modifying code, explain *why* the change is being made.
- Always check `server/db.ts` before adding new database operations.
- Maintain the "AI-friendly" documentation style.
